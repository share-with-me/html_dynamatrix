# html_dynamatrix
The html pages step1.html, step2.html, step3.html and step4.html contain the solutions of the tasks asked. The dataset data.csv (although it is tsv dataset), was taken from the link provided. 
Count.html helps to count the various intervals of sepalWidth belonging to different species and the data is stores in pie.csv (again a tsv data).
Given the timeframe, only the tasks asked have been implemented but it can be very well possible to improve the UI significantly (eg: with added legends, proper setting of DOM elements, etc)
