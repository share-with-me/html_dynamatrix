The html pages step1.html, step2.html, step3.html and step4.html contain the solutions of the tasks asked. The dataset data.csv (although it is tsv dataset), was taken from the link provided. 
Count.html helps to count the various intervals of sepalWidth belonging to different species and the data is stores in pie.csv (again a tsv data).
Given the timeframe, only the tasks asked have been implemented but it can be very well possible to improve the UI significantly (eg: with added legends, proper setting of DOM elements, etc).<br/><br/> It also contains a folder named 'Rickshaw.js_examples' which containes files which make use of Rickshaw.js, a visualisation library for time series analysis developed by shutterstock on d3.js <br/><br/>
The repo contains a folder named Dimple.js_examples which contain files making use of dimple.js (based in turn on d3.js itself) but enhances the capability of plotting.
